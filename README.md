# Homework 3: Survival Analysis

This repository contains the code and report for Homework 3 on Survival Analysis, assigned by Karen Hovhannisyan. The analysis focuses on understanding the factors influencing churn risk using parametric models and calculating Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).

## Dataset
The dataset includes various subscriber attributes such as ID, region, tenure, age, marital status, address tenure, income, education level, retirement status, gender, voice, internet usage, call forwarding, customer category, and churn indicator.

## Parametric Models
1. Built Accelerated Time-to-Failure (ATF) models with various distributions.
2. Compared the models based on performance metrics.
3. Visualized survival curves in a single plot.
4. Selected the most appropriate model considering additional factors beyond model comparisons.
5. Retained significant features for the final model.

## CLV Calculation
Calculated CLV per customer based on the final model, utilizing the logic presented in the slides. Explored CLV within different customer segments.

## Report
Provided a concise report interpreting coefficients, identifying valuable customer segments, estimating the annual retention budget, and suggesting retention strategies.

Feel free to explore the code and report for detailed insights into the analysis findings.
